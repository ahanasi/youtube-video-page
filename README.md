# Youtube Video Page Replica

This project was created as part of the The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video) to practice working with media elements on a basic webpage. The goal of this project was to replicate the layout of the Youtube video page and display video through the exclusive use of HTML and vanilla CSS.
